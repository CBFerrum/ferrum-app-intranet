# Changelog

## 0.1.14

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 9e7190c, the design system as tuned after the landed build was reviewed. The left menu's icons are chosen so that none repeats on more than three rows and each fits its row; their drawings load beside the first page instead of inside it, so the page starts lighter; a row that scrolls sideways fades at the edge where there is more, in every browser and with reduced motion; a printed record leaves out empty fields and keeps its totals with the table; menus and popovers sit inside the page's landmarks for assistive technology; a selection bar folds what does not fit into More on a narrow screen. Nothing else changes.

## 0.1.13

The interface follows the upgraded design system, rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 76c4fad. Text uses the kit's type roles (nothing under 12px) and controls its height tokens; loading shows skeletons shaped like what is coming; empty, no matches, denied, offline and failed are told apart; status colours come from stored state ids. The interface check now runs the UI lint against an empty baseline. The home is rebuilt on the kit's work-home pattern: one page title, the main action as a button, queues with their counts, status at its natural width; its other own pages follow the same anatomy.

## 0.1.12

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 43d7779: the names of its models, fields and manifest in Arabic and Hindi (63 each in ui/src/locales/names, which the platform serves to every page of the workspace, so a record's labels, the launcher and the bar read in the person's language). Translated by the model, to be reviewed by native speakers.

## 0.1.11

The assistant knows what its records mean in its pages (contributes.shell.assistant): their states, what counts and where figures come from, with questions it suggests asking there.

## 0.1.10

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 389b2af: its own words carry built-in Arabic and Hindi (13 words each, ui/src/locales, translated by the model and to be reviewed by native speakers), fetched for the page's language only. The labels it keeps in objects, its dialogs, its page titles and the words it keeps in variables go through t() as well, and the names and sizes it shows as they are keep their order right to left. Its pages are drawn once their words are in, and its entry carries only the parts of the kit it uses.

## 0.1.9

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 1f5981d: an action's link, code or token shown once is kept in a dialog to copy, and on a page that reads right to left, English left untranslated keeps its own order. Its own words go through the kit's t() (14 places), so a workspace's own words for its language reach them, and Admin, Interface words lists them under it (dist/words.json).

## 0.1.8

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 8a1c2e7: a workspace's own words for its interface (Admin, Interface words) reach its pages as they load; an attachment field that holds a picture shows it; and a value another record already has is said so, where the form said the record had been changed by someone else.

## 0.1.7

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 9d80f4f: right to left, its pages mirror as they read (icons that point along the line, margins and alignment by the line's start and end, arrow keys along it), and the records pages' words are in Arabic and Hindi.

## 0.1.6

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 204b713: a new record's box whose default is 1 shows ticked, as it is saved.

## 0.1.5

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 6cfda39: an action's dialog says every refusal, the errors on what the action made (another record's rows) among them, and an action with parameters and a confirmation asks once.

## 0.1.4

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend b39fffb: its pages show times on a person's own clock when they chose one on their Account page, while today and due dates stay on the workspace's day.

## 0.1.3

- The news shows the day an announcement was published on the workspace's clock, as members read
  times, rather than the browser's.
- Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend d350579: times on the workspace's clock.

## 0.1.2

From a browser walk on a running server (announcements to everyone and to a members-only space,
published, acknowledged by a member, and archived):

- A published or archived announcement's title, body, space and Ask to Acknowledge show read-only
  on its page. Before, they looked editable until saving was refused.
- Archive asks first, since an archived announcement is not published again.
- The news says when you acknowledged an announcement that asked, in place of the button.

## 0.1.1

Rebuilt with Ferrum-Frontend 20d08e5: a record page reads an empty number or check as the server does, so an action whose condition needs one shows, and a workspace's settings open as their one record.

## 0.1.0

The company intranet (Ferrum's FERRUM-ECOSYSTEM-001).

- **Spaces** for teams and topics:
  - who keeps each one and who is in it;
  - its pages, a Drive folder written in Docs;
  - its links, to the web or this workspace's pages. A link that would run a script, or reach another site through `//`, is refused.
  - A members-only space is seen by its owner and members alone.
- **Announcements**, written as drafts and published by an Intranet Editor:
  - to everyone, or in a members-only space to its owner and members as they are then, who alone may read it;
  - those it goes to are told in the app;
  - published, an announcement stays as it was posted, and only whether it is pinned and when it expires change;
  - one that asks is acknowledged by each reader once, with when;
  - archived by hand, or the day after it expires.
- **Its own interface at /intranet/:** the news meant for the reader, pinned first, with a button for those that ask to be acknowledged; and the spaces they may see, with their pages and links.
